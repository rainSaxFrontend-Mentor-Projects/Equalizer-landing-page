## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A major takeaway from doing this project was getting more practice with overlapping images using CSS Grid! The middle section of the page was all created using CSS Grid and I heavily used the grid-row and grid-column commands to place the components appropriately.

### Useful resources

- [Change svg on hover](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - This resource helped me to understand how to fill an svg element with a different color on hover.
